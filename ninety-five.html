        <h2> ABOUT BRUCE WAYNE</h2>
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p> Birth and Family:

            Bruce Wayne was born to Thomas and Martha Wayne, one of Gotham City's wealthiest and most influential families.
            The Waynes were philanthropists, using their wealth to help improve Gotham.
            Tragedy:
            
            When Bruce was eight years old, his parents were murdered in front of him during a mugging in Crime Alley after a night at the theater. This traumatic event profoundly shaped his life and instilled in him a deep-seated desire for justice.
            </p>
        <h4>Path to Batman</h4>
        <p>Training:

            Determined to avenge his parents and fight crime, Bruce traveled the world, undergoing rigorous physical and mental training.
            He studied various martial arts, detective skills, and criminal psychology. His mentors included experts in combat, stealth, and scientific disciplines.
            Return to Gotham:
            
            Bruce returned to Gotham City, ready to begin his war on crime. He chose the bat as his symbol, inspired by a bat that flew into his study, signifying fear and darkness.
            He created the persona of Batman, using his wealth to develop advanced technology and a high-tech suit.</p>
